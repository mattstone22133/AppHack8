# AppHack8
Our team's repo for app hack 8!

This was made during a hackathon. We got up early friday morning and started coding around friday ~7. We then coded until 10:30 the next day. 
Please note that this code was made under sleep depreived conditions and we acknowledge that it is sloppy; we started out strong but it got messy by the end.
There are also some blank classes that we didn't get around to implmenting - we nearly didn't finish. 

We used libgdx and followed the shading tutorial http://www.alcove-games.com/opengl-es-2-tutorials/lightmap-shader-fire-effect-glsl/ .
We used 3 simple shaders from that tutorial for blending. Art and sounds were either created or obtained from https://opengameart.org/

Before watching the game video, watch about 12 seconds of the follow video of a movie trailer. The video skips to the contextually relevant portion. When the reviewer is done talking about the comments section and shows the scene about the clown. Basically, he compares the evil clown to ronald McDonald going after after you have some burger king. So we transformed that into a game.
