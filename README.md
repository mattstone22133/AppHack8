# AppHack8
Our team's repo for app hack 8!

This was made during a hackathon. We got up early friday morning and started coding around friday ~7. We then coded until 10:30 the next day. 
Please note that this code was made under sleep depreived conditions and we acknowledge that it is sloppy; we started out strong but it got messy by the end.
There are also some blank classes that we didn't get around to implmenting - we nearly didn't finish. 

We used libgdx and followed the shading tutorial http://www.alcove-games.com/opengl-es-2-tutorials/lightmap-shader-fire-effect-glsl/ .
We used 3 simple shaders from that tutorial for blending. Art and sounds were either created or obtained from https://opengameart.org/
